# _**Solvate Suite**_

**OVERVIEW**

This is the repository for the _Solvate Suite_, a comprehensive software package designed to address various challenges in molecular modeling. The suite's modules interface with widely used open-source software such as _ORCA_, _xTB_, _GROMACS_, _PackMol_, and _Q-Force_, facilitating the sequential treatment of all stages of molecular modeling involving explicit interaction of the species of interest with the solvent, employing both molecular simulation procedures and electronic structure calculations in a hybrid approach (explicit/implicit solvation).

The _suite_ comprises multiple modules, each dedicated to addressing key aspects of molecular modeling:

(1) **Creation of Simulation Box**: This module allows users to create the simulation box according to specified criteria, including the number of solvent molecules, shape and density of the box, solute/solvent concentration, or proportions between solvent mixtures. It also determines force field parameters and constructs the system's topology for classical dynamics-based simulation methods.

(2) **Submission of Simulations**: From this module the user can run simulations with a minimum set of adjusted parameters. These parameters can be modified during runtime or users can use their own simulation parameters.

(3) **Analysis of Simulated Properties**: This module analyzes various simulated properties such as pressure, temperature, density, short-range interaction, total potential energy, and radial distribution function. It includes statistical analysis, graphical representation, and property extraction based on different criteria like block analysis and pressure filter.

(4) **Selection of Hydrogen-Bonded Structures and Microsolvation Clusters**: Users can select a predetermined number of hydrogen-bonded structures or microsolvation clusters, along with solvent molecules per cluster, identified from the simulation trajectory file based on connectivity or energy criteria.

(5) **Treatment of Microsolvation Clusters**: This module conducts semi-empirical Quantum Chemistry calculations on microsolvation clusters to calculate free energy. The module provides various treatment options, including: fixed geometry from simulation, completely optimized cluster structure, or relaxed solvent cavity with optimized solute geometry. The procedure eliminates imaginary frequencies, employs quasi-harmonic correction, and utilizes extrapolation methods for free energy calculations to the user-specified theory level.

(6) **Management of Generated Files**: The suite manages the significant number of files generated throughout the modeling process, ensuring efficient organization and storage.

Overall, the _Solvate Suite_ provides a comprehensive solution for molecular modeling tasks, addressing various complexities encountered in explicit solvent simulations.
