## USER MANUAL - QUICK GUIDE

**SUBMISSION OF SIMULATIONS**

2. From the MDRUN module, the submission of simulations with the ORCA and GROMACS programs is performed using the same 
   set of parameters. In the case of ORCA, the execution options are set directly in the `.inp` input file at run time 
   from the command line. In the case of GROMACS, the options are adjusted and saved in a specific `.mdp` settings 
   file.
