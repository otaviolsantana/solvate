Just run the following command:

 gmdff acetic.gro

This will create:

 acetic.gro
 acetic.itp
 acetic.zip

To visualize the structure, try:

 sview acetic.gro
 jmol acetic.gro
 vmd acetic.gro

Please note that, in this example, the anion charge initially recorded in the ITP file does not have an integer value. 
The GMDFF module corrected the residual charge in the new ITP file generated through the procedure.
