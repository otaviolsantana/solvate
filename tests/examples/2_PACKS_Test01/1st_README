Just run the following command:

   packs dimethylamine.inp water.inp -nm 250 -it -bk

to use the local files, or

   packs dimethylamine.inp water_noff.wtr -nm 250 -it -bk

to use the geometry and force field files from the database.

This will create:

   dimethylamine+water_mol250.inp
   dimethylamine+water_mol250.zip

To visualize the simulation box, try:

   sview dimethylamine+water_mol250.inp
   jmol dimethylamine+water_mol250.inp
   vmd dimethylamine+water_mol250.inp
