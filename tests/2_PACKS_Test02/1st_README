Just run the following command:

 packs dimethylamine.inp water.inp -ci hydroxyl.inp -nm 250 -it -bk

This will create:

 dimethylamine+water-hydroxyl_mol250.inp
 dimethylamine+water-hydroxyl_mol250.zip

To visualize the simulation box, try:

 sview dimethylamine+water-hydroxyl_mol250.inp
 jmol dimethylamine+water-hydroxyl_mol250.inp
 vmd dimethylamine+water-hydroxyl_mol250.inp
